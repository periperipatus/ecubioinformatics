# R Workshop materials

Here are the materials you'll need for the R component of the workshop

The materials are intended to be done in the following order:

## 1. Intro 1: Orientation and basic R

This is in the file `Ex1_Orientation.R`. For beginners, we will start here together. You can view these tutorials on GitHub or in the OneDrive folder I shared with you.

Run through the code in this document in your own R-studio. 

 
## 2. Intro 2: Functions and Packages

This is in `Ex2_FunctionsAndPackages`. 


## 3. Control Structures in R

How to write loops and conditional statements in `Ex3_ControlStructures.R'

## 4. Data Tools

Here we will cover some other essentials for R in genomics and the sciences more broadly through:
`R Markdown`, `ggplot2`, and `tidyr` data manipulation. This component has been modified from a tutorial by Prof. Mike McCoy. 

On your OneDrive, view the instructions in the file `Ex4.html`. 

In your R-Studio Window you will fill in your R Notebook using `Ex4_workbook.Rmd`. 
Upon opening this file, R-Studio should automatically prompt you to install all the necessary packages to run `R Notebook` & `Rmarkdown`.
