# UNC Bioinformatics Course 2020


I am just testing things at the moment

#heading

```R
test<- read.csv("table.csv")
test$add<- seq(from=1, to=10, by=2)
```

what if I put inline #!/bin/bash

or like this ```grep "MELK" genome.gtf```

```
### this is probably more like what it is
blah blah
```

```bash
echo 'MELK'
```
